Problem Solving Logic 
1.Understand the problem: read the question once, twice or more until you get a clear understanding of it 
2. See the technical (function) description: What is it asking you to do?
3. Look at the sample input and output format, if you misinterpret you won't get the test cases cleared, even if your logic is correct
Pay attention to the line by line output!
4.Consider constraints.If input is large, you have to optimise to pass test cases.(time and space complexities) 
5.Split the function into smaller parts for easier debugging 
6.If you can't understand what the code does print some of the variables to see the output for a particular input
7.Understand the patterns for input and output, look at the examples visually or draw them and find patterns for the  solution
8.Write the pseudo code in steps 
9.What data type and method(s) should you use?
10.Write the code in steps and with your own comments 
11.Run the test cases 
12. Submit your code for review 
13. If your code is wrong turn to the Discussions or/and Editorial for better understanding of the solution
