Problem-Solving Logic üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

1. Understand the problem, don‚Äôt rush through it: read the question out loud once, twice or more until you get a clear understanding of it. Ask questions or google what you aren‚Äôt sure about

2. See the technical (function) description: what is it asking to do? What data type and method(s) should you use?

3. Redefine the problem and draw what it is on a whiteboard (auto draw website)

4. Look at the sample input and output format, if you misinterpret you won't get the test cases cleared, even if your logic is correct Pay attention to the line by line output!

5.Consider constraints: if input is large, you have to optimise to pass test cases.(binary search, time and space complexities)

6.Split the function into smaller parts for easier debugging

7.If you can't understand what the code does, print some of the variables to see the output for a particular input.

8. Setup Structure: understand the patterns for input and output,functions, look at the examples visually or draw them and find patterns for the¬† solution!

9. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems: This makes it easier to solve

10. Start on a paper, write the pseudo code in steps and with your own comments, even in your native language! The simpler the solution, the better

11.Try different approaches: Don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques. There is no single "best" way to solve a¬† problem. The most important thing is to understand it, choose an appropriate technique, and use your pseudo code to write efficient and correct code

12.Look back and review: have a solution, optimize and clean-up code, comment what you do, make improvements! (demonstrates attention to the quality of your work)

13.Run the code, test for edge cases with custom inputs, check for unexpected inputs and errors 

14.Submit your code for review! If it is wrong turn to the Discussions or/and Editorial for better understanding of the solution

15.Problems By Data Structure:

Arrays & Lists: sorting, searching (linear, binary), traversing, manipulation (insertion, deletion, update)

Strings: Indexing, slicing, searching (pattern matching), manipulation (concatenation, formatting).

Linked Lists: traversing, insertion, deletion, reversing

Stacks & Queues: pushing, popping, peeking, implementation using arrays or linked lists

Trees & Graphs: traversal (BFS, DFS), searching, finding specific nodes, pathfinding

Hash Tables: key-value storage, insertion, deletion, lookup

16.By Problem Type:

Implementation: translate problem description into code efficiently

Problem-solving:understand the problem, analyze constraints, design an algorithm

Data analysis: process and interpret data to answer questions

Mathematical:solve problems involving mathematical concepts.
