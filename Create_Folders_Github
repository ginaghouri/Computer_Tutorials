The steps for creating a folder in a GitHub repo are simple but not immediately clear. Two rules: you must have a repo and you can’t create empty folders. Provided you satisfy those conditions, the following steps will result in a new folder:

Make sure you’re in an existing repository
Click "creating a new file" if the repo is empty or Add file > Create a file if not.
Type the name of the folder in the input field, followed by a forward slash character.
Type the name of the new file you wish to create in the folder. Note: GitHub doesn’t allow the creation of empty folders.
